# sirpinskies-shapes
This is a repository filled with c programs written with the glut.h library to draw multiple sirpinskis shapes. 

PLEASE READ
understand that I wrote these programs in python turtle and used ChatGPT to convert the code into C. the carpet was written by me by hand modifying the code. No GPT did not write the original program, only 
converted the python to C.
